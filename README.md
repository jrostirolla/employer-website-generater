## Description
Hi there, and welcome to my roster writer!
To use my app, simply download the repo files to your desktop and run the file in your console
You will be prompted to answer a series of questions in regards to the file you wish to generate. Answer them all and the program will produce a new roster for you

## Note
In the current version of the software, the file does not write. This issue will hopefully be patch in version 2.0
